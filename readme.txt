== Description ==

Introducing **AI Scribe**, the **ultimate ChatGPT SEO Content Creator, Article Writer & SEO Assistant**. 

Configurable for **GPT-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-3.5-TURBO, GPT-3.5-TURBO-16K, and GPT-4-16K**, this open-source AI solution is designed to automate your content creation process with SEO and keyword research set from the outset. AI Scribe is not just an AI content writer, but also a **premium SEO content optimiser** that enhances and optimises your content based on tried-and-tested prompts. 

With AI Scribe, you can generate SEO optimised content for your website with ease using the models behind OpenAI and ChatGPT. This free WordPress plugin offers customisable options that allow you to tailor your content to your specific needs. All prompts are fully visible and editable at each stage, and these can be changed or saved globally allowing you to find-tune the entire content creation process. It's both desktop and mobile friendly, allowing usability on all devices. Whether you're looking to create blog posts, articles, or other forms of content, AI Scribe is your go-to solution.

With the addition of GPT-3.5-Turbo-16K, it’s now possible to create longform articles with lighting speed and efficiency. Models like GPT-4 are great but slower and more expensive than the cheaper and faster GPT-3.5-Turbo model. For users that have been granted early access to GPT-4-32K, AI Scribe has this compatibility built in. 

More than just a content generator, AI Scribe is a comprehensive AI content solution that integrates seamlessly with your WordPress environment and provides full compatibility and integration with both the classic editor and Gutenberg block editor. The plugin is also compatible with popular SEO plugins such as Yoast SEO, Rank Math, AIOSEO and SEOPress, providing AI generated meta data which is auto saved to these plugins along with focus keywords. For page builders like Divi or Elementor, or pages built using widgets or dynamic custom fields like ACF, you can take advantage of the ‘save as shortcode’ option. 

AI Scribe offers features such as keyword research, keyword optimisation, structured content generation, and uses a simple wizard-like article builder interface to guide you through the entire process. Thorough testing has shown that the plugin is capable of creating high-quality content that passes both human and Google tests, ensuring that your website ranks high in search engine results.

= Caveats of Using GPT =

1. Hallucinations: AI models may generate false information or hallucinate. Verify generated facts and figures before publishing.
2. No live or real-time data: GPT models only contain information up to September 2021 and are not connected to the internet for real-time data.
3. Inconsistent responses: AI models may sometimes provide results in inconsistent or random ways due to their nature.

= SEO Guidelines =

1. Check everything including keyword usage: Ensure the content flows well and does not suffer from keyword stuffing or over-optimisation.
2. Check for duplicate content and plagiarism: Use tools like Copyscape to ensure the content is unique and not copied from other sources.
3. Personalise and add value: Make the content unique and valuable to improve its chances of being indexed and ranked by search engines.
4. AI detection tools: Be aware that AI-generated content may be detected by tools like GPTZero and OpenAI's AI Text Classifier. Personalising and refining content can help it pass as human-written.
