AI-Scribe is both desktop and mobile-friendly, allowing usability on all devices. Whether you're looking to create blog posts, articles, or other forms of content, AI Scribe is your go-to solution.

With the addition of GPT-3.5-Turbo-16K, it’s now possible to create long-form articles with lighting speed and efficiency. Models like GPT-4 are great but slower and more expensive than the cheaper and faster GPT-3.5-Turbo model. For users that have been granted early access to GPT-4-32K, AI Scribe has this compatibility built in. 

More than just a content generator, AI Scribe is a comprehensive AI content and blog writing solution that integrates seamlessly with your WordPress environment and provides full compatibility and integration with both the classic editor and Gutenberg block editor. The plugin is also compatible with popular SEO plugins such as Yoast SEO, Rank Math, AIOSEO and SEOPress, providing AI generated meta data which gets auto saved to these plugins along with focus keywords. For page builders like Divi or Elementor, or pages built using widgets or dynamic custom fields like ACF, you can take advantage of the ‘save as shortcode’ option. 

AI Scribe offers features such as keyword research, keyword optimisation, structured content generation, and uses a simple wizard-like article builder interface to guide you through the entire process. Thorough testing has shown that the plugin is capable of creating high-quality content that passes both human and Google tests, ensuring that your website ranks high in search engine results.

== WHAT'S NEW ==

**Compatibility Check**
Good news, everyone! The plugin is now fully compatible with WordPress 6.3.1. So, you can keep your WordPress up-to-date without a hitch.

**Custom Instructions**
Ever wanted more control over the conversation, the kind you get with ChatGPT Plus and its custom instructions option? We've added a custom instructions prompt on the main settings page. It's perfect for those of you using GPT-3 or GPT-4 and these instructions apply to each and every prompt. 

**Exclude Words & Phrases**
If like us you get frustrated by common words and phrases being created by ChatGP, you can add these to your Custom Instructions. By deafult, we have excluded the following words but you are able to remove and edit these as needed:

 As A Professional, Previously Mentioned, Buckle Up, Dance, Delve, Digital Era, Dive In, Embark, Enable, Emphasise, Embracing, Enigma, Ensure, Essential, Even If, Even Though, Folks, Foster, Furthermore, Game Changer, Given That, Importantly, In Contrast, In Order To, World Of, Digital Era, In Today’s, Indeed, Indelible, Essential To, Imperative, Important To, Worth Noting, Journey, Labyrinth, Landscape, Look No Further, Moreover, Navigating, Nestled, Nonetheless, Notably, Other Hand, Overall, Pesky, Promptly, Realm, Remember That, Testament, Remnant, Revolutionize, Shed Light, Symphony, Dive Into, Tapestry, Testament, That Being Said, Crucial, Considerations, Exhaustive, Thus, Put It Simply, To Summarize, Unleashing, Ultimately, Underscore, Vibrant, Vital

== CAVEATS OF USING GPT ==

1. Hallucinations: AI models may generate false information or hallucinate. Verify generated facts and figures before publishing.
2. No live or real-time data: GPT models only contain information up to September 2021 and are not connected to the internet for real-time data.
3. Inconsistent responses: AI models may sometimes provide results in inconsistent or random ways due to their nature.

= SEO GUIDELINES =

1. Check everything including keyword usage: Ensure the content flows well and does not suffer from keyword stuffing or over-optimisation.
2. Check for duplicate content and plagiarism: Use tools like Copyscape to ensure the content is unique and not copied from other sources.
3. Personalise and add value: Make the content unique and valuable to improve its chances of being indexed and ranked by search engines.
4. AI detection tools: Be aware that AI-generated content may be detected by tools like GPTZero and OpenAI's AI Text Classifier. Personalising and refining content can help it pass as human-written.

== FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ==

= How does AI Scribe use AI engines like GPT-3, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4? =

AI Scribe integrates with OpenAI's GPT-3, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4 engines to generate content based on your input and preferences. It provides prompts and suggestions to help you create SEO-optimised content efficiently.

= Are there any costs associated with using AI Scribe? =

AI Scribe itself is free to download and use, but you will need access to OpenAI's API, which may have associated costs depending on your usage. Please check OpenAI's pricing for more details: [https://openai.com/pricing](https://openai.com/pricing)

= How can I customise the prompts in AI Scribe? =

AI Scribe allows you to edit prompts at each stage of the content creation process. You can use your own instructions and pre-defined shortcodes/parameters, such as [Language], [Style], and [Keywords Selected]. Custom default prompts can also be saved within the global settings page. As well as custom prompts, you can now also add custom instructions to be applied alongside all prompts with GPT-3 and GPT-4 models. 

= What are ChatGPT custom instructions? = 

Custom instructions in ChatGPT allow you to guide the model's behaviour during a conversation. These instructions can be used to specify rules, guidelines and aspects of the generated text. For AI-Scribe, the custom instructions take advantage of OpenAI's "system" role within the messages you exchange as a "user". This only works for GPT-3 and GPT-4. 

= How do I ensure the generated content aligns with my brand voice and tone? =

AI Scribe provides configurable options for language, style, and tone. By selecting the appropriate settings, you can create content that matches your brand's voice and tone, ensuring a consistent user experience across your website.

= Can I use AI Scribe with page builders like Elementor and Divi? =

Yes, AI Scribe offers multiple usage options, including saving the content as a shortcode. This allows you to use the generated content within widgets, modules, and page builders like Elementor and Divi.

= How can I evaluate the quality of the content generated by AI Scribe? =

AI Scribe provides evaluation features that assess your content's quality, although these results should be taken with a pinch of salt. Future updates plan to integrate third-party tools for a more accurate and detailed evaluation.

= What if I encounter token issues while generating content? =

Token issues may occur for very long articles or when using specific AI engines. To resolve token issues, consider shortening the content or switching to a different AI engine that supports a higher token limit, like GPT-4.

= What is an LLM (Large Language Model) abnd why do I need to know this? =

An LLM, or Large Language Model, is a sophisticated type of artificial intelligence that excels at understanding and generating human-like text. These models, such as GPT-3, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4, are designed to process and manipulate language in a way that makes them incredibly versatile and useful for a wide range of applications.

LLMs like GPT-4 are trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing them to comprehend and generate text in a natural and coherent manner. You can think of LLMs as digital wordsmiths capable of crafting content, answering questions, and engaging in conversations with humans. They can be harnessed to automate tasks, streamline content production, and provide valuable insights.

Whether you're seeking to create SEO-optimised articles or engaging blog posts, understanding how LLMs like GPT-4 work can help you to generate higher-quality content. 

For more information, check out our [how does ChatGPT work](https://www.opace.co.uk/blog/how-does-chatgpt-work) article, which explains all of these concepts in a simple story form. 

= What are the differences between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4? =

**IIntelligence and speed**
GPT-4 is smarter and can handle longer prompts and conversations without making as many factual errors. On the flip side, GPT-3.5 is faster in generating responses.

**Model size and parameters**
GPT-4 has a much larger model size, rumoured to be around 1 trillion parameters, compared to GPT-3's 175 billion parameters. This allows GPT-4 to handle more complex tasks and generate more accurate responses.

**Training data and contextual understanding**
GPT-4 has a larger training dataset, which gives it a broader knowledge base and improved contextual understanding. This translates into better accuracy and the ability to handle longer text passages and maintain coherence.

**Resource requirements and cost**
The advancements in GPT-4 come at the cost of increased computational power requirements, making it more expensive to run.

**Context windows**

GPT-4 can retain more information from your chats, allowing for improved responses based on your conversation. It can handle around 8K tokens, whereas GPT-3.5-Turbo is limited to 4K tokens. GPT-3.5-Turbo-16K can handle roughly 16K tokens and GPT-4-32K can handle 32K tokens. 

= How do tokens work? =
Tokens are the building blocks that language models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 use to read and process text. A token can be as short as one character or as long as a word. For example, the word "apple" could be a single token. Tokens are not always whole words; they can also be parts of words or even include spaces.

As a rule of thumb, one token is roughly equivalent to 4 characters in English text or 0.75 words.

**For example:**

* 100 tokens are about 75 words.
* A sentence with 1-2 lines might take up around 30 tokens.
* A paragraph could be around 100 tokens.
* 1,500 words would be around 2,048 tokens.

The number of tokens that can be processed depends on the model you're using. For instance, you can use up to 4,097 tokens shared between the prompt and completion. If your prompt uses 4,000 tokens, the completion can have 97 tokens at most.

Understanding tokens is crucial for two main reasons:

* Cost: OpenAI charges based on the number of tokens processed.
* Speed: Generating more tokens requires more time.

= What if I don't like the content created by AI Scribe? =

It's important to remember that AI Scribe doesn't actually create the content. The plugin defines prompts, rules and guidelines to help instruct the OpenAI model you select. The more refined your prompts and custom instructions, the more likely you will be happy with the content. However, even with the exact same prompts and instructions, you can often get very different results due to the random nature of how  LLMs work. If the response doesn't look correct or you are not happy, please follow these suggestions:

* Simply click the "Regenerate" button next to the response or click the "Update settings or prompt" button next to the prompt without making any changes - either option will run the prompt again and the second run may be more to your liking
* Manually update the prompt and then click the "Update settings or prompt" button - sometimes minor changes and even re-ordering the elements of the prompt can make a big difference
* Check and modify the custom instructions prompt on the main settings page 

You can always test these prompts and custom instructions directly by logging into OpenAI and accessing the link here: [https://platform.openai.com/playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground)

= Who created the plugin? =

AI Scribe was designed and developed by a UK based digital marketing agency called [Opace](https://www.opace.co.uk).

= Where can I get my OpenAI API key = 
If you don't have an OpenAI account yet, you can sign up for one here: [https://beta.openai.com/signup](https://beta.openai.com/signup).

Log into your OpenAI account. Click your username in the top right hand corner and select “View API keys".Then on the next screen, create or copy an API key.
