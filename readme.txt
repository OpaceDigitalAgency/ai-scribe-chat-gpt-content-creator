== Description ==

Introducing **AI Scribe**, the **ultimate SEO AI Writer, Content Generator & Humaizer using ChatGPT (GPT-4o)**. 

Configurable for **OpenAI GPT-4 (GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini)**, this open-source AI WordPress Plugin is designed to automate your content creation process with SEO and keyword research set from the outset. AI Scribe is not just an AI writer, but also a **premium SEO content optimiser** and **humanizer** that enhances and optimises your content based on tried-and-tested prompts. 

With AI Scribe, you can generate SEO optimised content for your website with ease using the models behind OpenAI and ChatGPT. This free WordPress plugin offers customisable options that allow you to tailor your content to your specific needs. All prompts are fully visible and editable at each stage, and these can be changed or saved globally allowing you to fine-tune the entire content creation process. We've even built in a range of prompt shortcodes to give you greater control over your content. 

[Language]
[Style]
[Tone]
[Title]
[Selected Keywords]
[The Tagline] - using [above/below] for the position
[No. Headings]
[Heading Tag]
[Keywords to Avoid]

**Please note:** With GPT-4, some of these have now been incorporated into the custom instructions, in particular language, style, and tone. This means they are no visible within the prompt itself but will be saved for use within the instructions used. 

AI-Scribe is both desktop and mobile-friendly, allowing usability on all devices. Whether you're looking to create blog posts, articles, or other forms of content, look no further than AI Scribe.

AI Scribe v2.0 brings the addition of GPT-4o, so it’s now possible to create long-form articles with lighting speed, cost, and efficiency. You can choose between gpt-4o and gpt-4o-mini and also include an SEO-optimised DALLE-3 image. 

**GPT-4o:**
Max tokens: 128,000 tokens (huge capacity for complex/long tasks).
Cost: Approx. $0.00075 per 1,000 tokens (input), $0.001 per 1,000 tokens (output)

**GPT-4o mini:**
Max tokens: 128,000 tokens (same large context window).
Cost: Approx. 50% cheaper than GPT-3.5 Turbo—$0.00075 per 1,000 tokens (input), $0.001 per 1,000 tokens (output)

**[Correct as of 13.10.24]**

The following models have been deprecated - gpt-4-1106-preview, gpt-4-vision-preview, gpt-3.5-turbo-1106, gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo-16k, gpt-4-32k, and text-davinci-003.

More than just a content generator, AI Scribe is a comprehensive AI content and blog writing solution that integrates seamlessly with your WordPress environment and provides full compatibility and integration with both the classic editor and Gutenberg block editor. 

The plugin is also compatible with popular SEO plugins such as Yoast SEO, Rank Math, AIOSEO and SEOPress, providing AI generated meta data which gets auto saved to these plugins along with focus keywords. For page builders like Divi or Elementor, or pages built using widgets or dynamic custom fields like ACF, you can take advantage of the ‘save as shortcode’ option. 

AI Scribe offers features such as keyword research, keyword optimisation, structured content generation, and uses a simple wizard-like article builder interface to guide you through the entire process. 

Thorough testing has shown that the plugin is capable of creating high-quality content that passes both human and Google tests, ensuring that your website ranks high in search engine results. With v2.0 of AI Scribe, we have now even introduced two **Humanizer** modes – “Humanizer” and “Humanizer with Personality” – you need to see the result to believe it! Just watch the videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrH78g3kmwA) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHY1pEM6fCo).

== AI-SCRIBE GPT VERSION NOW AVAILABLE ==

For those who prefer to use ChatGPT natively, we have now released the AI-Scribe GPT below:

[https://chat.openai.com/g/g-ZTkBnCIbA-gpt-seo-article-creator-ai-scribe](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-ZTkBnCIbA-gpt-seo-article-creator-ai-scribe)

With the addition of [custom GPTs](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts) for ChatGPT Plus users, this GPT works without purchasing OpenAI credits as long as users have a [Plus account](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus). It also comes with some bells and whistles that are not currently available in the WordPress plugin version, including:

* Continual input and clarification at each stage of the article writer 
* Auto save as MS Word at each stage 
* Auto generation of relevant images using Dall-e 3 (saved as separate files and embedded within MS Word)
* Browse the web feature with the ability to summarise data as tables, charts and graphs
* Download final version as MS Word

This could of course be used in conjunction with WordPress and copied to a post once saved. The U/X isn't as nice as the plugin and it's slower to use but it does provide the above benefits.

== WHAT'S NEW IN V2.0 ==

**Compatibility Check**
Compatibility with WordPress version 6.7.1.

**Depreciated Models**
Older, less efficient and more expensive models removed.

**GPT-4o and GPT-40-mini (128K models)**
You now have access to models that are faster, cheaper and produce far higher-quality output than GPT-3.5-turbo. 

**Streamlined Code**
Now we’ve been able to remove all those additional and unnecessary steps to cater for older models like Davinci and GPT-3.5, the code is much cleaner and more focussed on OpenAI’s current approach to integration. 

**DALLE-3 image insertion**
Generates a high-quality DALLE-3 image based on the article title (without the nonsense words and symbols included) and inserts into the post.

**Improved article SEO optimisation**
Automatically achieves SEO scores of 70 or more out-of-the-box on most tests (checked using RankMath)

**Superior Prompts**
All of the prompts have been re-tested and improved according to what works best with GPT-4o.  

**Custom Instructions**
These have been modified so that there are now three-levels of custom instructions, i.e. the “behind the scenes” instructions that gets sent with your prompts:
* Standard Mode
* Humanizer Mode
* Humanizer with Personality Mode

**Humanizer Modes**
These are modes that accompany style and tone but go far beyond simply asking for “creative” writing or a “formal” style. They add levels upon levels of instructions to help insert nuance that only human writers have been able to provide:

* **Standard Mode:** This is the basic, no-frills writing mode. When using this, AI Scribe follows specific instructions like writing in plain language, adhering to spellings rules, and avoiding certain buzzwords or jargon that are most common with ChatGPT. It aims to generate straightforward, high-quality content with a clear focus on SEO and readability. Think of this mode as the professional, direct approach to writing. You can of course always give this mode an edge by modifying the Style and Tone options. 
* **Humanizer Mode:** In this mode, the writing becomes more relaxed and mimics how a real person might write, complete with natural imperfections. AI Scribe is told to make vary sentence lengths, use everyday language, include personal anecdotes, etc. This helps make the content feel less robotic and more like it was written by a human, even though it's still created by AI. The focus is on authenticity and sounding more casual or conversational.
* **Humanizer with Personality Mode:** This takes the Humanizer Mode a step further. Here, the writing becomes not only natural but also playful, sarcastic, and quirky. The AI will add humour, make witty comments, and might even challenge popular opinions or trends. It's meant to give the content a unique, memorable voice—perfect for engaging readers in a more informal, bold way.

Each mode builds on the previous one, starting from professional and polished (Standard) to human-like (Humanize) and finally to full-on personality-driven content (Personality), depending on the tone you want to strike with your audience.

== CAVEATS OF USING LLMs (LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS) LIKE GPT ==

1. Hallucinations: AI models may generate false information or hallucinate. Verify generated facts and figures before publishing.
2. No live or real-time data: GPT models only contain information up to September 2021 and are not connected to the internet for real-time data.
3. Inconsistent responses: AI models may sometimes provide results in inconsistent or random ways due to their nature.

= SEO GUIDELINES =

1. Check everything including keyword usage: Ensure the content flows well and does not suffer from keyword stuffing or over-optimisation.
2. Check for duplicate content and plagiarism: Use tools like Copyscape to ensure the content is unique and not copied from other sources.
3. Personalise and add value: Make the content unique and valuable to improve its chances of being indexed and ranked by search engines.
4. AI detection tools: Be aware that AI-generated content may be detected by tools like GPTZero and OpenAI's AI Text Classifier. Personalising and refining content can help it pass as human-written.

== FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ==

= Are there any costs associated with using AI Scribe? =

AI Scribe itself is free to download and use, but you will need access to OpenAI's API, which may have associated costs depending on your usage. Please check OpenAI's pricing for more details: [https://openai.com/pricing](https://openai.com/pricing)

= How can I customise the prompts in AI Scribe? =

AI Scribe allows you to edit prompts at each stage of the content creation process. You can use your own instructions and pre-defined shortcodes/parameters, such as [Language], [Style], and [Keywords Selected]. Custom default prompts can also be saved within the global settings page. As well as custom prompts, you can now also add custom instructions to be applied alongside all prompts with GPT-3 and GPT-4 models. 

= What are ChatGPT custom instructions? = 

Custom instructions in ChatGPT allow you to guide the model's behaviour during a conversation. These instructions can be used to specify rules, guidelines and aspects of the generated text. For AI-Scribe, the custom instructions take advantage of OpenAI's "system" role within the messages you exchange as a "user". This only works for GPT-3 and GPT-4. 

= How do I ensure the generated content aligns with my brand voice and tone? =

AI Scribe provides configurable options for language, style, and tone. By selecting the appropriate settings, you can create content that matches your brand's voice and tone, ensuring a consistent user experience across your website.

= Can I use AI Scribe with page builders like Elementor and Divi? =

Yes, AI Scribe offers multiple usage options, including saving the content as a shortcode. This allows you to use the generated content within widgets, modules, and page builders like Elementor and Divi.

= How can I evaluate the quality of the content generated by AI Scribe? =

AI Scribe provides evaluation features that assess your content's quality, although these results should be taken with a pinch of salt. Future updates plan to integrate third-party tools for a more accurate and detailed evaluation.

= What if I encounter token issues while generating content? =

Token issues may occur for very long articles or when using specific AI models. To resolve token issues, consider shortening the content or switching to a different AI engine that supports a higher token limit, like GPT-4.

= What does it mean if nothing gets displayed? =

From time to time during testing, we encounter extremely long processing. When this happens, we normally see the progress bar for a prolonged period. Then when it finishes loading, the page is blank. This usually happens with slower models like GPT-4, longer articles, or when OpenAI is under strain due to high usage. When this happens, it can cause a timeout (504 Gateway Timeout) error to occur. 

= What if I encounter timeout issues? =

Hopefully, this won't happen too often as we've added max_token restrictions back in with v1.2.4, which should limit timeout errors on all models. However, if you do encounter this, we would suggest changing your model to "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k" on the settings page.


**Resource requirements and cost**
The advancements in GPT-4 come at the cost of increased computational power requirements, making it more expensive to run.

**Tokens and context windows**

GPT-4 can retain more information from your chats, allowing for improved responses based on your conversation. It can handle around 8K tokens, whereas GPT-3.5-Turbo is limited to 4K tokens. GPT-3.5-Turbo-16K can handle roughly 16K tokens and GPT-4-32K can handle 32K tokens. The latest GPT-4o models that we've added allow for up to 128K tokens.

= How do tokens work? =
Tokens are the building blocks that language models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 use to read and process text. A token can be as short as one character or as long as a word. For example, the word "apple" could be a single token. Tokens are not always whole words; they can also be parts of words or even include spaces.

As a rule of thumb, one token is roughly equivalent to 4 characters in English text or 0.75 words.

**For example:**

* 100 tokens are about 75 words.
* A sentence with 1-2 lines might take up around 30 tokens.
* A paragraph could be around 100 tokens.
* 1,500 words would be around 2,048 tokens.

The number of tokens that can be processed depends on the model you're using. For instance, you can use up to 4,097 tokens shared between the prompt and completion. If your prompt uses 4,000 tokens, the completion can have 97 tokens at most.

Understanding tokens is crucial for two main reasons:

* Cost: OpenAI charges based on the number of tokens processed.
* Speed: Generating more tokens requires more time.

= What if I don't like the content created by AI Scribe? =

It's important to remember that AI Scribe doesn't actually create the content. The plugin defines prompts, rules and guidelines to help instruct the OpenAI model you select. The more refined your prompts and custom instructions, the more likely you will be happy with the content. However, even with the exact same prompts and instructions, you can often get very different results due to the random nature of how LLMs work. If the response doesn't look correct or you are not happy, please follow these suggestions:

* Simply click the "Regenerate" button next to the response or click the "Update settings or prompt" button next to the prompt without making any changes - either option will run the prompt again and the second run may be more to your liking
* Manually update the prompt and then click the "Update settings or prompt" button - sometimes minor changes and even re-ordering the elements of the prompt can make a big difference
* Check and modify the custom instructions prompt on the main settings page 

You can always test these prompts and custom instructions directly by logging into OpenAI and accessing the link here: [https://platform.openai.com/playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground)

= Who created the plugin? =

AI Scribe was designed and developed by a UK based digital marketing agency called [Opace](https://opace.agency).

= Where can I get my OpenAI API key = 
If you don't have an OpenAI account yet, you can sign up for one here: [https://beta.openai.com/signup](https://beta.openai.com/signup).

Log into your OpenAI account. Click your username in the top right hand corner and select “View API keys".Then on the next screen, create or copy an API key.
