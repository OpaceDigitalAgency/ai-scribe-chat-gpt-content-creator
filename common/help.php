			<strong>AI-SCRIBE OVERVIEW</strong>
		</h2>
		<div class="box">
			<p>Welcome to
				<strong>AI-Scribe</strong>, the ultimate ChatGPT-powered content creation wizard. AI-Scribe will take
				your writing to the next level using 
				<strong>GPT-4</strong> from OpenAI, the same ones behind the
				<strong>famous ChatGPT tool.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Initially created as an experiment to see how well AI models like GPT-3 could create SEO optimised
				content, the results were astonishing. So, in the spirit of open source, AI-Scribe was created as a
				WordPress plugin so users could experiment with its features, prompts, and provide suggestions for
				future updates.</p>
			<p>AI-Scribe helps to take the guesswork out of content creation and SEO, by giving you prompts and
				suggestions throughout the entire writing process to help you stay on track and create content that's
				both informative and engaging.</p>
			<p>What sets AI-Scribe apart is its focus on SEO, by integrating keyword optimisation and SEO best practice
				throughout the content creation process. This helps to ensure your content is fully optimized for search
				engines from the outset.</p>
			<p>You will also get a powerful and fully configurable interface, allowing you to edit and fine-tune the
				prompts and settings. This gives you complete control over the content creation process, making it easy
				to create content that aligns with your unique goals and objectives.</p>
			<p>And best of all, AI-Scribe is
				<strong>completely free to download and use</strong>. This is not a commercial plugin and there are no
				hidden features or add-ons that require payment. It has been designed to be accessible to everyone,
				regardless of their level of experience with SEO and content creation.
			</p>
			<p>Having tested other tools and plugins that use the same technologies, AI-Scribe was designed to
				incorporate some of the best ideas but take things one step further by building a plugin that would
				deliver additional benefits.</p>

		<h2>
			<strong>KEY FEATURES</strong>
		</h2>
		<div class="box">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>SEO-driven from the outset </strong>From brainstorming the initial ideas through to
					publishing the content, SEO plays a fundamental role throughout your experience using AI-Scribe. All
					prompts have been carefully created and tested based years of experience delivering SEO. The plugin
					will even create meta data that can integrate with the Yoast plugin or be copied for use with other
					plugins.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Keyword optimisation made easy</strong>&nbsp;Rather than simply creating an article based on
					a single title or idea, AI-Scribe provides keyword suggestions, where you can select keywords, ask
					for more, and control how the keywords influence your content. Simply provide your article title and
					AI-Scribe will generate keywords and phrases in your chosen language.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Perfectly structured content </strong>
					<span>The best content is always unique, carefully planned, and well structured. AI-Scribe was designed based on
                      <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/anatomy-perfect-blog-post">HubSpot&rsquo;s The Anatomy of a Perfect Blog Post</a> to help guide users through the process of creating AI content of an exceptional quality. No more missing introductions or conclusions, it&rsquo;s kind of like an in-built checklist to ensure you consider all of the key ingredients. You can even create relevant Q&amp;A&rsquo;s that are great for featured snippets in search results.
                    </span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Wizard-like article builder interface </strong>AI-Scribe is not like other &lsquo;playground
					like&rsquo; plugins where you add a single prompt and get a fully-fledged AI article. Here you get
					11 customisable steps, where you can create articles that are tailored to your specific needs. Each
					step is fully visible and editable, giving you the freedom to plan, create, structure, and fine-tune
					your content as you need, in exactly the same way as writing it manually. You can even choose to
					skip steps and leave AI-Scribe to decide, regenerate results, provide more suggestions, or go back
					to a previous step.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Content that can pass the human test </strong>Until the end of 2022 with the release of
					ChatGPT, AI content creation tools were largely incapable of passing the human test. This means AI
					generated content that is indistinguishable from human written content. For this reason, AI-Scribe
					only includes options to use GPT-3, GPT-3.5 or GPT-4. All settings and prompts have been carefully
					tested to ensure AI-Scribe passes the human test.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Content that can pass the Google test </strong>
					<span>With the SEO and keyword features built in from beginning to end, you are guaranteed to get content that is optimised but that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean it will rank in search engines. AI content has the best changes of ranking well when you take full use of the options and prompts provided by AI-Scribe to create, review and refine the content at each stage of the process. This way, you are more likely to create content that will rank. For more guidance,
                      <a href="#caveats">see here</a>.
                    </span>
				</li>
				<li>
                    <span>
                      <strong>Configurable options - </strong>
                      <br/>Whilst this is not unique to AI-Scribe, you will find options to control the language, structure and features, including:
                    </span>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<strong>Language, Style &amp; Tone</strong>&nbsp;A selection of popular languages, styles
							and tones to create content that matches your brand's voice and tone and is fine tunned to
							your audience
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Headings </strong>The ability to fine-tune how many headings are created and the
							HTML tags used to structure your content
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Additional </strong>The ability to avoid certain keywords and add extra features
							such as a Table of Contents, bold keyword formatting, and more.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Visible prompts and ability to revise them </strong>
					<span>One of the greatest features of AI-Scribe is the in-build prompts that have been carefully engineered. But more than that, you can edit the prompts at each stage of the process using your own instructions and our pre-defined shortcodes/parameters, such as [Language], [Style], [Keywords Selected]. For a
                      <a href="<?php echo esc_url(admin_url( 'admin.php?page=Settings#prompt-settings' )); ?>" target="_blank">full list see here</a>. You can even save your own custom default prompts within the global settings page.
                    </span>
				</li>
				<li>
                    <span>
                      <strong>A range of usage options - </strong>
                      <br/>WordPress is a powerful platform, with various options for creating and designing content. From the inbuilt Gutenberg editor to page builders and themes such as Elementor and Divi, there&rsquo;s no one size fits all. This is why AI-Scribe provides three main options for using the content:
                    </span>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<strong>Save as post</strong>&nbsp;This will save the final article as a draft within the
							standard posts section of WordPress
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Save as shortcode</strong>&nbsp;This will save the final article as a shortcode for
							use within widgets, modules and page builders.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Copy</strong>&nbsp;Every single piece of generated content can be copied to your
							clipboard with a simple button click for use anywhere.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Evaluation features </strong>AI engines like GPT-3 and GPT-4 can write, revise, translation,
					summarise, and so much more. With all this in mind, AI-Scribe has been designed to provide a final
					evaluation of your content. This needs to be taken with a pinch of salt as the results aren&rsquo;t
					always 100%. For example, GPT-3 and 4 are both notoriously bad at calculating word counts (counting
					anything really). They also have a habit of making things up, but the assessment provided can still
					be useful. Future updates to AI-Scribe are planned to integrate with third-party tools to get a more
					accurate and detailed evaluation.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h2 id="caveats">
			<strong>CAVEATS AND GUIDELINES</strong>
		</h2>
		<div class="box">
			<p>Whilst we believe the plugin is capable of creating excellent content, we need to give some important
				caveats. If you decide to use and publish the content created, you do this at your own risk. As an SEO
				agency, we never advise publishing fully automated content, especially not out-of-the-box.</p>
			<h3>CAVEATS OF USING GPT</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Hallucinations</strong><span> AI models like these are known for making up very believable facts and sometimes hallucinate. For more information, <a
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)">read more here</a>. So, make sure you verify any infromation generated, espeically facts and figures.</span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>It's not live or connected to the Internet</strong><span> Models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 only contain information up to September 2021. Despite what some people may say, as of March 2023, these models are not connected to the Internet and are unable to use or verify real-time information.
                    </span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>AI can respond in random ways</strong><span> During testing, we found that the plugin will sometimes provide responses in inconsistent (almost random) ways. This isn't a bug. It just means that even when using the exact same prompt format, you may get results in a different format. This is the result of the selections made and the random nature of AI.
                    </span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span><strong>Consider your model carefully</strong> Each GPT model has different features and different pricing models, which can affect your experience using the plugin considerably. <br/><br/> <strong>GPT-4 </strong>is the very latest design, provides the best results and can handle much larger amounts of text. To date, we've found fewer issues using this model with AI-Scribe, but it's also the slowest and most expensive. For the GPT-4-8K model, requests can use a maximum of 8,192 tokens (approx. 6,000 words). <br/><br/> <strong>GPT-3</strong> (text-davinci-003) gives the most consistent results but the quality and accuracy will not be as good as GPT-4. Requests can use a maximum of 2,048 tokens (approx. 1,500 words) or a combined total of 4000 tokens for the request and response. For this reason, we tend to find that AI-Scribe can encounter token issues when producing longer articles or longer requests/prompt usage. <br/><br/> <strong>GPT-3.5-Turbo</strong> is by far the lowest cost but we've also experienced some of the most inconsistent results using this model. Requests can use a maximum of 4,096 tokens (approx. 3,000 words) but we've found that the results will also provide unwanted text, such as notes, labels and explanations. The text also seems to flag higher on AI content detection tools.&nbsp;</span>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>SEO GUIDELINES</h3>
			<p>Our plugin was created as an experiment to see whether AI models like GPT-3 were finally able to create
				SEO optimised content that would pass for human. It wasn&rsquo;t developed to replace a human.
				Therefore, we suggest that special care and attention is always taken before making any content live,
				including:</p>
			<ul>

				<li>
					<strong>Check everything including keyword usage </strong>
					<span>We&rsquo;ve configured the plugin to produce well written and well optimised content, but AI is a law unto itself and will often make its own decisions. Therefore, we suggest always reading the content thoroughly to ensure it reads and flows well. Check keyword usage to ensure you don&rsquo;t suffer from keyword stuffing or over-optimisation. You can find a
                      <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/keyword-density">great guide and tips here</a>
                    </span>.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Check for duplicate content and plagiarism </strong>
					<span>In our experiments, the plugin hasn&rsquo;t generated any duplicate content, i.e. content that is copied or plagiarised from other sources. But for those who follow SEO, duplicate content is a bad thing and can be penalised by Google. Therefore we always suggest double checking this using a tool like
                      <a href="https://www.copyscape.com/">Copyscape</a> before making the content live. If duplication exists, re-write that text and make it unique.
                    </span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Personalise and always add value </strong>Our experience is that search engines like Google
					will frequently decide not to rank or even index poor quality content &ndash; this includes a lot of
					AI content that is being generated. Search engines may even penalise a website for poor quality
					content. However, they will index and rank content that is unique, meaningful and provides value.
					Regardless of whether the content is written by a human, repurposed from elsewhere or even automated
					using AI, the content will rank providing it&rsquo;s personalised to say something unique and add
					value (something new that&rsquo;s not a simple rehash of existing content). For the best results,
					take advantage of each step and prompt, tailor the settings, and refine to make the content your
					own. This will also make the article more SEO centric. However, if you choose to skip steps, be
					aware that the opposite is likely and you may end up with a more generic fully AI generated result.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>AI detection tools </strong>
					<span>Various tools are now available to help detect AI content such as the popular
                      <a href="https://gptzero.me/">GPTZero</a> and 
                      <a href="https://platform.openai.com/ai-text-classifier">OpenAI&rsquo;s own AI Text Classifier tool</a>. These aren&rsquo;t always accurate, but they are improving with time. By personalising the content at each stage and refining the results, you will have better chances of the content passing as human when using AI detection tools like these.
                    </span>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The plugin is also reliant on a new/emerging technology. As such, there are many unknowns. For example,
				what direction OpenAI may take with its services. For now, access to the API is free for limited usage
				but this may change. It&rsquo;s also unknown how search engines like Google will treat AI-generated
				content or how governments/institutions will respond to the massive surge in the popularity and use of
				AI.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>ISSUES &amp; BUGS</h2>
		<div class="box">
			<p>In addition, the plugin is in the early stages of development and we are aware of some bugs and
				limitations that we hope can be ironed out:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Evaluation accuracy</strong> The evaluation stage needs enhancing. GPT-3 and GPT-4 are bad
					at calculating word counts and have a habit of making things up. Due to the nature of AI, we&rsquo;ve
					found the results aren&rsquo;t always consistent and can sometimes come back in a different format
					creating display bugs. Future improvements are planned along with integration with third-party tools
					to get a more accurate and detailed evaluation.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Max token issues</strong>Token issues can occur for very long articles, especially at the
					end stages of the process such as Evaluation. This is more of a limitation of OpenAI and will depend
					on whether you are using GPT-3 or GPT-4, rather than a bug.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Please bear in mind that AI-Scribe has been designed and tested to work with the current prompts. Any
				major deviations in the prompts used may cause issues with the result/display and be incompatible with
				the existing code.If you spot any bugs with the core features or functionality,
				<a href="">please let us know here</a>.
			</p>
			<p>If you have any ideas or suggestions,
				<a href="">please let us know here</a>.
			</p>
			<p>This is not a commercial plugin with a dedicated development team, so support will be limited to critical
				issues or suggestions initially. However, we will endeavour to review all messages and respond as soon
				as possible.</p>
